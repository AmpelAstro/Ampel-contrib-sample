    "#### AMPEL intro\n",
    "\n",
    "AMPEL is software framework designed for processing heterogeneous streamed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "AMPEL was not developed to provide a specific scientific resource, but rather an environment where it is easy to ensure that a scientific program fulfills the strict requirement of the next generation real-time experiments: efficient and powerful analysis, where provenance and reproducibiltiy is paramount. In particular, to guarantee the last point requires algorithms (which make real-time deicsions) be separated from infrastructure (which will likely evolve with time and project phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "An AMPEL _user_ constructs a configuration file which describes every step of how an incoming alert stream should be processed. This can be broken down into selecting which _units_ should be executed, and which _parameters_ each of these should be provided. An AMPEL _live instance_ executes these units, based on the input data, as requested and stores all intermediate and final data in a databse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Provenance/reproducibility is ensured through multiple layers. First, each live instance is run from a container which can be retrieved later and together with a data archive replay the full stream. Second, AMPEL contains an extensive set of logs and a transient-specific _Journal_ which details all related actions/decisions. Finally, each unit and channel configuration file is drawn from a specific (tagged) github version. \n",
    "\n",
    "The series of notebooks provided here gradually builds toward a sample full configration. "

    "#### Sample science case\n",
    "\n",
    "Each AMPEl _channel_ is designed with a science goal (or \"hypothesis/test\") in mind. A much discussed current topic is the origin of the extragalactic neutrino flux observed e.g. by IceCube, with one of the potential sources being supernovae interacting with circumstellar material (SNIIn). We here wish to investigate whether a particular subtype of these, SN2009ip-like SNe with recent previous outbursts, are regularly found within the uncertainty region of neutrino alerts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for this science program would be: Identify transients with optical lightcurves compatible with SN2009ip AND which coincide with neutrino alerts. For such targets, obtain follow-up spectroscopy to confirm classification (i.e. an external reaction). "

    "#### This notebook - Tutorial 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks mimics one approach for how multi-messenger data can be combined with the ZTF optical stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "A unit - `T2MultiMessMatch` - retrieves a recent list of potential multi-messenger events, together with information of their spatial, temporal and energetics properties. It will then return a combined \"p-value\" of how closely these match the properties of the optical transients. A set of scaling factors determine the relative weight between these dimensions. A real unit would read this information from a local mirror of e.g. LIGO/VIRGO or IceCube events, while we here use an invented event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path to unit: `Ampel-contrib-sample/ampel/contrib/sample/t2/T2MultiMessMatch.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step of this notebook is the selection of events we consider \"good\" matches, based on having a small p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in Tutorial 2, this notebook thus assumes a mongod instance to be running and accessible through 27017. (The port can be changed through the mongo key of the ampel_config.yml file).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of \"non-native\" multi-messenger matching: a main stream is being compared with an (at any given point in time) fixed set of external regions. AMPEL can also carry out \"native\" multi-messenger programs, where non-heterogeneous streams are ingested into the system. This adds analysis power, but adds the complexity of creating transient states in the T1 AMPEL tier. \n"

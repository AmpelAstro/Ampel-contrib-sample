# Style guidelines

## Use pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks check your commits for obvious mistakes like invalid
syntax in Python or JSON files.  [Install pre-commit on your
machine](https://pre-commit.com/#installation), then activate the
hooks with `pre-commit install`.  The configured hooks will then
run before every commit, either fixing the files to be committed
or telling you what's wrong.
